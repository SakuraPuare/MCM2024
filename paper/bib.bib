  abstract     = {SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) plays a vital role in navigation tasks of AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). However, due to a vast amount of image sonar data and some acoustic equipment's inherent high latency, it is a considerable challenge to implement real-time underwater SLAM on a small AUV. This paper presents a filter based methodology for SLAM algorithms in underwater environments. First, a multi-beam forward looking sonar (MFLS) is utilized to extract environmental features. The acquired sonar image is then converted to sparse point cloud format through threshold segmentation and distance-constrained filtering to solve the calculation explosion issue caused by a large amount of original data. Second, based on the proposed method, the DVL, IMU, and sonar data are fused, the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF)-based SLAM method is used to estimate AUV pose and generate an occupancy grid map. To verify the proposed algorithm, the underwater vehicle is equipped as an experimental platform to conduct field tasks in both the experimental pool and wild lake, respectively. Experiments illustrate that the proposed approach achieves better performance in both state estimation and suppressing divergence.},

  abstract     = {In the scenario where an underwater vehicle tracks an underwater target, reliable estimation of the target position is required. While USBL measurements provide target position measurements at low but regular update rate, multibeam sonar imagery gives high precision measurements but in a limited field of view. This paper describes the development of the tracking filter that fuses USBL and processed sonar image measurements for tracking underwater targets for the purpose of obtaining reliable tracking estimates at steady rate, even in cases when either sonar or USBL measurements are not available or are faulty. The proposed algorithms significantly increase safety in scenarios where underwater vehicle has to maneuver in close vicinity to human diver who emits air bubbles that can deteriorate tracking performance. In addition to the tracking filter development, special attention is devoted to adaptation of the region of interest within the sonar image by using tracking filter covariance transformation for the purpose of improving detection and avoiding false sonar measurements. Developed algorithms are tested on real experimental data obtained in field conditions. Statistical analysis shows superior performance of the proposed filter compared to conventional tracking using pure USBL or sonar measurements.},

@article{Submarine,
  abstract     = {Substances released at sea by accident or illegal discharges are characterized by a broad range of chemical and physical properties. Moreover, the characteristics of coastal waters, e.g. in the German Bight, are highly variable. Due to this a submersible sensor network for the detection of hazardous substances on the seafloor combining several instruments based on different physical and chemical principles has been under development since 1996. In addition to conventional sensors for seawater analysis and seafloor monitoring such as CTD probes (conductivity, temperature, depth) and video cameras, the system includes several newly developed instruments for the detection of dissolved and sunken pollutants. One of these instruments is the submarine lidar, combining a range-gated imaging device and a fluorescence lidar. A q-switched Nd:YAG laser is used as the common light source. Applying the expanded frequency-doubled laser pulse the gated CCD camera is particularly useful for recording images of damaged containers with chemical cargo where harmful substances might be released into the water column. Tuned to UV emission, the same laser is used for remotely classifying fluorescent substances spreading on the seafloor. The intention of this paper is to present the submarine lidar in detail and to give an overview of its physics and potential applications.},

    abstract = {Bathymetric mapping is an important tool for reservoir management, typically completed before reservoir construction. Historically, bathymetric maps were produced by interpolating between points measured at a relatively large spacing throughout a reservoir, typically on the order of a few, up to 10, meters or more depending on the size of the reservoir. These measurements were made using traditional survey methods before the reservoir was filled, or using sonar surveys after filling. Post-construction issues such as sedimentation and erosion can change a reservoir, but generating updated bathymetric maps is difficult as the areas of interest are typically in the sediment deltas and other difficult-to-access areas that are often above water or exposed for part of the year. We present a method to create complete reservoir bathymetric maps, including areas above the water line, using small unmanned aerial vehicle (sUAV) photogrammetry combined with multi-beam sonar data—both established methods for producing topographic models. This is a unique problem because the shoreline topographic models generated by the photogrammetry are long and thin, not an optimal geometry for model creation, and most images contain water, which causes issues with image-matching algorithms. This paper presents methods to create accurate above-water shoreline models using images from sUAVs, processed using a commercial software package and a method to accurately knit sonar and Structure from Motion (SfM) data sets by matching slopes. The models generated by both approaches are point clouds, which consist of points representing the ground surface in three-dimensional space. Generating models from sUAV-captured images requires ground control points (GCPs), i.e., points with a known location, to anchor model creation. For this study, we explored issues with ground control spacing, masking water regions (or omitting water regions) in the images, using no GCPs, and incorrectly tagging a GCP. To quantify the effect these issues had on model accuracy, we computed the difference between generated clouds and a reference point cloud to determine the point cloud error. We found that the time required to place GCPs was significantly more than the time required to capture images, so optimizing GCP density is important. To generate long, thin shoreline models, we found that GCPs with a ~1.5-km (~1-mile) spacing along a shoreline are sufficient to generate useful data. This spacing resulted in an average error of 5.5 cm compared to a reference cloud that was generated using ~0.5-km (~1/4-mile) GCP spacing. We found that we needed to mask water and areas related to distant regions and sky in images used for model creation. This is because water, objects in the far oblique distance, and sky confuse the algorithms that match points among images. If we did not mask the images, the resulting models had errors of more than 20 m. Our sonar point clouds, while self-consistent, were not accurately georeferenced, which is typical for most reservoir surveys. We demonstrate a method using cross-sections of the transition between the above-water clouds and sonar clouds to geo-locate the sonar data and accurately knit the two data sets. Shore line topography models (long and thin) and integration of sonar and drone data is a niche area that leverages current advances in data collection and processing. Our work will help researchers and practitioners use these advances to generate accurate post-construction reservoir bathometry maps to assist with reservoir management.},

    abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation and localization in underwater environments is particularly challenging due to the rapid attenuation of Global Positioning System (GPS) and radio-frequency signals. Underwater communications are low bandwidth and unreliable, and there is no access to a global positioning system. Past approaches to solve the AUV localization problem have employed expensive inertial sensors, used installed beacons in the region of interest, or required periodic surfacing of the AUV. While these methods are useful, their performance is fundamentally limited. Advances in underwater communications and the application of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology to the underwater realm have yielded new possibilities in the field. This paper presents a review of the state of the art of AUV navigation and localization, as well as a description of some of the more commonly used methods. In addition, we highlight areas of future research potential.},

    abstract = {Abstract Numerical experiments with idealized OGCM are carried out to investigate the oceanic eastern boundary problems. The experimental results indicate that the eastward flow due to the north–south gradient of the surface density returns to the interior region through the lower half of the mixed layer, and this return flow generates a density jump just above the thermocline. Formulation for the mixed layer depth distribution at the eastern boundary is also presented, which is derived only from the geostrophy and no-normal flow condition. This formulation agrees well with the numerical experiment, and can be an appropriate eastern boundary condition for theoretical ventilated thermocline model with no deficiency of the mass balance on the boundary. Furthermore, the effects of such eastern boundary structure on the subtropical thermocline are studied. On the shallow thermocline in the subtropics, eastern boundary ventilated region emerges, which is identified as a region of high potential vorticity. In t...},
